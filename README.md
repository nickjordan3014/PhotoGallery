    Portfolio Project for DIG4639

# Application Description

    This application will be a basic photo gallery made using three different react components.

# Component 1 - Creating the Gallery

    The first componen gathers all the data for the current album and sends it to the second component

# Component 2 - Gallery Slideshow

    The second component maps all of the image items for each of the galleries

# Component 3 - Rating Page

    The third component is a prototype rating page. This component creates a form that the user can click radio buttons and critique the photo gallery.

# Returning to the main page

    The last function on the first component will allow the user to return to the main menu page to view a different gallery.
